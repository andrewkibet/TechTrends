#### Tiktok Ban in Us

As of January 19, 2025, TikTok has ceased operations for its 170 million U.S. users due to a federal ban. This action follows a Supreme Court ruling upholding a law that required ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to divest its U.S. operations by January 19 or face a ban.

Despite the Biden administration's initial decision not to enforce the ban, the responsibility has now shifted to the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has indicated a willingness to grant a 90-day extension to allow TikTok more time to find a non-Chinese buyer, potentially reinstating the app's availability in the U.S.

In the interim, TikTok users attempting to access the app are met with notifications about the ban, and the app has been removed from Google Play and Apple's App Store. Some users are exploring alternatives, such as using VPNs to bypass restrictions, though these methods come with their own challenges and risks.

The future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain, contingent upon forthcoming decisions by the new administration and potential negotiations involving ByteDance and prospective buyers.

For this assignment, you will create three forensic images.  Please follow the instructions below.

1. The first image you create will be of a thumb drive.  It is highly recommended that you use a thumb drive that is smaller in capacity, though any thumb drive will work.  Copy a number of files to the thumb drive, delete some of the files, and then remove the thumb drive from the computer you are using.

2. Get a trial license of SafeBlock from ForensicSoft.  Install the application and use it to write block your USB ports.  (Don't forget to unblock them later).  Here is The User Guide for SafeBlock.

3. Insert the thumb drive.  Using FTK Imager, create a physical image of the drive in .e01 format.  Other settings are within your discretion, however, you must authenticate the process with a MD5 hash value.  Describe the process in your report and attach the Image Summary document.

4. The second image you create will be a FTK Imager Custom Content Image.  Create the the Custom Content Image using any of the files you copied to the thumb drive.  Authenticate the process with a MD5 hash value.  Describe the process in your report and attach the Image Summary document.

5. Last, use any technique and software combination (bootable forensic disk, remove hard drive, etc.) to image one other device or media item.  You can image a CD/DVD, micro SD card, hard drive, SD card, etc. but it cannot be a thumb drive.  Be sure the drive is properly write-blocked (please note that this step is not necessary for CD/DVD).  If you can find a way to image a hard drive, that is the optimal way to complete this exercise (boot Windows system to forensic imaging media, remove a hard drive and put it in an adapter to image over USB, etc.).  Authenticate the process with a MD5 hash value.  Describe the process in your report and attach any document generated by the forensic software (if it does), or alternatively attach a screenshot or photograph demonstrating you have successfully completed the process.  For this exercise, you can use FTK Imager but you don't have to.  Feel free to use another process or tool that you already know, want to research, etc.  Just be sure that you use the tool properly, demonstrate best practices in evidence handling, and authenticate your evidence with a hash value.

Please Note: When you have successfully completed these exercises, you can securely delete all of the forensic images so they don't take up too much space.  Also, be sure to remove write protection from your USB drives so they function properly.
