#### Tiktok Ban in Us

As of January 19, 2025, TikTok has ceased operations for its 170 million U.S. users due to a federal ban. This action follows a Supreme Court ruling upholding a law that required ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to divest its U.S. operations by January 19 or face a ban.

Despite the Biden administration's initial decision not to enforce the ban, the responsibility has now shifted to the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has indicated a willingness to grant a 90-day extension to allow TikTok more time to find a non-Chinese buyer, potentially reinstating the app's availability in the U.S.

In the interim, TikTok users attempting to access the app are met with notifications about the ban, and the app has been removed from Google Play and Apple's App Store. Some users are exploring alternatives, such as using VPNs to bypass restrictions, though these methods come with their own challenges and risks.

The future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain, contingent upon forthcoming decisions by the new administration and potential negotiations involving ByteDance and prospective buyers.
