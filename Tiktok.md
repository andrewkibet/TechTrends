# Tiktok's Ban Lifted

As of January 19, 2025, TikTok was officially banned in the United States following a Supreme Court decision upholding a law that required ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to divest its U.S. operations by that date. Failure to do so resulted in the app being removed from major app stores, and services were halted.

However, shortly after the ban took effect, President-elect Donald Trump announced intentions to "save" TikTok, leading to the app beginning to restore its services in the U.S.

As of now, TikTok is operational in the U.S., but its future remains uncertain. The platform's continued availability depends on forthcoming decisions by the new administration and potential negotiations involving ByteDance and prospective buyers to address national security concerns.
