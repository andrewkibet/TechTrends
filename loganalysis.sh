#I have been reading about log analysis in linux systems. On Linux systems, 
#log files accumulate data from applications and system processes. They monitor 
#various conditions of application, state changes, information, and errors. Growing log files 
#can consume storage space and then be difficult to manage and review. Automated log rotation is
# used to solve this storage issue.
