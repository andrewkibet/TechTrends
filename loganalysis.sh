I have been reading about log analysis in linux systems. On Linux systems, 
log files accumulate data from applications and system processes. They monitor 
various conditions of application, state changes, information, and errors. Growing log files 
can consume storage space and then be difficult to manage and review. Automated log rotation is
 used to solve this storage issue.
